There are three ways of going through the visualisation.

#### TO INTERACT WITH LARGE SIZED VISUALISATION

*The "outputs" Directory has four separate visualisation without any code, and the visualisation is large and very clear and can be accessed with any browser. The files need to be downloaded as **.html** files.*

#### TO VIEW CODE AND INTERACT WITH MEDIUM SIZED VISUALISATION

*"Notebook.html" shows the code used as well as the output as medium sized, similar to a Jupiter notebook output and can be accessed with any browser. The file need to be downloaded as **.html** file.*

#### TO RUN CODE AND INTERACT WITH LARGE SIZED VISUALISATION

To run the code and then see the visualisation, follow the below instructions.
The prerequisite for this method of run is **Python3**.

***STEP 1 IS IMPORTANT- FOR RELATIVE PATH TO WORK***
